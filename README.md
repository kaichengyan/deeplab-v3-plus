# deeplab-v3-plus

This is a PyTorch implementation of the DeepLab-v3+ model.
This is basically a subset of the
[pytorch-deeplab-xception](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception)
repo authored by @jfzhang. This repo is intended for
further research.

The model was originally proposed in this paper:
[Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for
Semantic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611).
